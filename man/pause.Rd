\usage{
pause(seconds)
}
\arguments{
\item{seconds}{Number of seconds to pause.}
}
\description{
This function pauses an R process for some amount of time. It differs from
\code{\link{Sys.sleep}} in that time spent in \code{pause} will show up in
profiler data. Another difference is that \code{pause} uses up 100% of a CPU,
whereas \code{Sys.sleep} does not.

# Wait for 0.5 seconds
pause(0.5)
